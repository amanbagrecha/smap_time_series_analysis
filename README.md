# Perform Time-Series Analysis of soil moisture from SMAP L3 Product 

> Product in use: SMAP L3 Radiometer Global Daily 36 km EASE-Grid Soil Moisture, Version 7

## Description
We perform time-series analysis of soil moisture for Bengaluru city with bounds 
```
N_lat =  13.07 ,S_lat =  12.82 , W_lon =  77.1 , E_lon =   77.9
```
The three main process we perform are:

- Download the SMAP L3 data for the latest one month ( August 2021 here).
- Extraction of the soil moisture values from SMAP L3 data over Lat, Lon of Bangalore in python.
- Plot the time series plot for the extracted soil moisture values for the latest one month. 



## üõ†Ô∏è Usage
To see it in action run the [colab notebook](https://github.com/amanbagrecha/smap_time_series_analysis/blob/main/colab_wrapper.ipynb) and follow the instructions there
